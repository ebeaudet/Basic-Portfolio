            <p>
                I am 38 years old I live in Philadelphia, PA. I have been working in IT for close to 20 years. I
                started
                off in
                a
                data center, moved over to a helpdesk
                and did some desktop support. I moved on to some front end software support and now I am learning front
                end
                development to help devlop the software ive
                been supporting for the last 10 years.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my free time I listen to music and attend concerts. I have been to well over 500 shows. I have some
                some
                bands
                over 100 times each. I
                have travelled all over the US and even followed a band over to Europe for 2 weeks. My favorite band is
                Phish,
                but
                I have seen Billy Joel, The Police, The Gorillaz.
                Music is a universal language that can bring people from all walks of life together for a little while
                with
                some
                common ground, to forget about life for a while and enjoy
                some music.
